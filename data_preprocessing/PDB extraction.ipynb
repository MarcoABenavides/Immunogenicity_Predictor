    "This script processes protein data for two datasets—`tumor_antigens_non-immunogenic` and `tumor_antigens_immunogenic`—by automating structure retrieval and visualization. For each UniProt ID listed in an Excel file within these folders, the script attempts to retrieve the corresponding experimental 3D structure from the PDBe database. If unavailable, it falls back to downloading the AlphaFold-predicted structure. Once the structure is obtained, it extracts the coordinates of alpha carbon (Cα) atoms and the corresponding amino acid types. Using this information, the script generates a 2D Voronoi diagram where each region represents a residue and is color-coded by amino acid type. The resulting diagrams are saved as PNG images, and the Excel files are updated with structure metadata and file paths. The script also logs any failed structure retrieval attempts and avoids reprocessing previously handled entries.\n"
